## Accessibility Features

- “Skip to content” link so that users with screen readers can choose to skip the header text to the blog content
- Uses relative font sizing (rem units), which respects the users preference while keeping a legible base-font-size
- 100% responsive, will adjust itself to look decent on any screen size.
- Focus styles so that keyboard only users can easily find their position on the page.
- Semantic HTML5 elements and elements with proper ARIA roles that allow for screen reader users to better navigate the page
- Obvious link styling so that people can easily distinguish links in the body of a post
- Default color scheme is WCAG compliant
- Screen reader specific labels such as alt text on icons.
- Implementation of the {TagsAsClasses} tag, which means that all post tags show up as CSS classes so that people who might want to block certain tags can easily do so by blocking the class element with an adblocker/some other blocking program.
